This folder contains code and material for the Assignment 1.

If you use the terminal, compile and run 'main.c' as follows: 

Linux/Mac:
- To compile: gcc cbmp.c main.c -o main.out -std=c99
- To run: ./main.out example.bmp example_result.bmp

Windows:
- To compile: gcc cbmp.c main.c -o main.exe -std=c99
- To run: main.exe example.bmp example_result.bmp

The folder 'samples' provides you with sample images for the 3 different levels of detection difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. Here you can also find the level 'impossible'. This level of difficulty is not part of the assignment. It is here just in case you really want to challenge your algorithm ;-)
